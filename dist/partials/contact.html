			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>It all started for Charlie and Raymond Babbit when they took an unplanned roadtrip from Cincinnati to Los Angeles in their late father's 1949 Buick Roadmaster.</p>
			<p>Charlie loves Italian cars and Italian women. He also likes to wear suits without a tie, but strangely with the shirt buttoned completely up as if he were wearing one. He does not like Kmart.</p>
			<p>Raymond is an excellent driver. He enjoys fish sticks on Wednesdays, orange soda, dancing, and watching Judge Wapner's daily distribution of justice on "The Peoples' Court". He prefers boxers to briefs and was until recently a Kmart shopper.</p>
